## P1 – The Trap of Comparison

**<mark>People often feel left behind in life, but constant comparison only leads to anxiety and insecurity, creating a vicious cycle.</mark>**

Do you ever feel like other people are way ahead of you in life, to the point where it feels almost impossible to catch up? I want to talk about something that I feel like we all go through at some point in time — which is feeling like we’re not doing enough, we’re not achieving our goals fast enough, and we’re not living up to these societal standards of a typical timeline for life. It’s easy to compare ourselves to other people around us, especially with all the stuff that we see online, and then we naturally wonder how other people have it so great. Personally for me, each year that I get older I think maybe I should have gotten to a certain point in life, or maybe I should have a more stable career, more friends. But in the end, this way of thinking just makes me feel worse about myself, more nervous, and insecure — which honestly just doesn’t help me at all. It’s just this vicious circle.</mark>**

## P2 - Defining Happiness for Yourself

**<mark>True happiness and success must be defined by yourself, not by social media or societal standards. Knowing what you truly want is the first step toward real happiness.</mark>**

So today I want to share some things that have helped me when I start having these thoughts, and have changed my whole perspective on feeling behind in life. First of all, I would think about what happiness and success truly mean to me — really dig deep and think about it. When you imagine a happy life, what comes to mind? Don’t get caught up in something you feel like you should want or compare yourself to what other people have. Really think about who you are at your core. In your happiest moments, what made you feel happy? Many people, including myself, don’t have the exact answer for this, and we’ve all been pretty heavily affected by social media nowadays. We’re stuck in this kind of bubble where the algorithm only shows a few certain lifestyles, which limits our understanding of other ways to live happily. But instead of trying to get what others have, thinking about what you truly want out of life is a step in the right direction toward real happiness.

## P3 The Value of Simple Living

**<mark>Material standards like luxury cars or branded goods do not equal happiness. Life’s meaning comes from experiences, relationships, and appreciating small moments of joy.</mark>**

Oftentimes people can get swept up in societal standards — thinking they need a perfect house, a luxury car, lots of money, or designer bags. But sometimes we forget that the point of life is simply to live it, experience things fully, find hobbies we love, discover creative outlets, and spend time with family and friends. Tomorrow is never promised, and life is unpredictable, so you might as well enjoy the life you have while you still have it. There’s no point in longing for what others have and lamenting what you don’t. Comparison is the thief of joy. One person might have more money, but do they have better health, a loving family, or close friends? Someone who looks successful might not even be truly happy. What we see on the surface often isn’t an accurate picture of what’s really going on in someone’s life. There will always be people who are smarter, younger, or more successful, but instead of stressing out, I find it comforting. I know I don’t have to be the best; all I can do is try my best, and find moments that make life worth living.

## P4 - Everyone Has Their Own Timeline

**<mark>Comparisons can sometimes inspire new possibilities, but everyone has a different life pace. Failures are part of growth, and the journey matters more than the result. Keep learning and improving, and life will naturally fall into place.</mark>**


Sometimes making comparisons is just human nature — and in certain situations, it can even be helpful. For example, when I felt hopeless about my future, looking at other people inspired me to see new possibilities. Growing up in a small town with nothing much going on, life felt limited. But when I saw other people online and later moved to a bigger city, I realized there are endless opportunities. Instead of discouraging me, this motivated me to explore different paths. Even failures became steps forward, because every experience teaches something. I’ve come to believe the journey is more valuable than the result. Finding happiness in small everyday moments is the key to a balanced life. In college, I also saw students of all ages chasing new beginnings, reminding me that the past doesn’t define our future. Everyone’s timeline is different, and there’s no need to rush. Progress takes time. The important thing is to keep learning, improving, and enjoying the present. Whether you know your dream or not, as long as you don’t give up, things will naturally fall into place.
